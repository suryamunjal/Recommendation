Recommendation Systems
A Recommendation system can be simply thought of as system providing relevant suggestions to users. The suggestions could vary in different contexts like for Amazon it would be product recommendations , for Netflix it would be movie recommendations , for Spotify it would be a simple song recommendation . 

Recommender systems are particularly useful when an individual needs to choose an item from a potentially overwhelming number of items that a service may offer. Lets say you are viewing a product on Amazon , you might see a banner like ” Customers who have bought this product also bought these items ” . Even on Netflix , you might see a banner like ” Because you watched this movie , you might like this these movies”. All these are part of recommendations systems being built by these huge tech giants.

Welcome to the world of recommendation systems.

Recommendation system always has atleast 2 entities : Users and Items . Users can be customers in amazon or users of Netflix or anything . Items can be products for amazon , movies for Netflix , books for a book store , songs for Spotify and the list goes on.

Generally speaking, we would always have a dataset with user and Items interactions recorded . Lets take an example of Netflix , we would have data like user i has given movie j rating of 3 or we could have data like user i has watched movie j , so we might record all watched movie interactions as 1 and non watched as 0. We can get any type of data. For a website like Youtube , we could have a data like user i watched video j for 5 sec . These are all a type of interaction data .

Now these type of recommendation problems can be solved using many approaches . Also approaches have evolved over time with deep learning and higher compute resources available. Some of the common approaches we will discuss are

1) Content Based Recommendation System

2) Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System Using similarity Based Methods

3) Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System Using Matrix Factorization

4) Neural Collaborative Filtering ( NCF – Deep Learning Approach )

Remember with advent of deep learning and fast compute resources , more and more companies are getting shifted to NCF based approach .

Hybrid Approach

There is no one technique which is used by any company . Many companies might take recommendation from 2-3 approaches and then recommend the best out of them. This is like a hybrid approach. . Companies can use any strategy to recommend provided it give best results.
